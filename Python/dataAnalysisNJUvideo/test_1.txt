Let's consider a specific example: a risk manager is asked by a lending officer to increase the line of business for a very solid obligor. A rigid risk policy would simply reject this request, but that is certainly not always the right answer. Rather, some firms prefer to take an agile risk management approach that assesses the marginal contribution of an additional loan to the overall risk distribution.
